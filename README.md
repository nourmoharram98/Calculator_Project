Task Description: Group Calculator Project 
Objective: Each group member is tasked with implementing a specific mathematical function for a collaborative calculator project. The project will be managed using Git to assess version control . 


Functions to Implement: 
-> Sum Function: 
             . Implement a function that adds two numbers. 
             . Ensure the function handles both positive and negative numbers. 
-> Subtraction Function: 
             . Develop a function for subtracting one number from another. 
             . Account for negative results and validate the implementation. 
-> Multiplication Function: 
             . Create a function that multiplies two numbers. 
             . Test the function with various inputs, including decimals. 
-> Division Function:
             . Implement a function for dividing one number by another. 
             . Handle potential division by zero scenarios and validate accuracy. 
-> Modulo Function:
             . Develop a function to find the remainder of the division of two numbers.
             . Test the function with different inputs to ensure correctness.
